## What is the LemonSlice Self-Managed Pipeline?

The LemonSlice Self-Managed Pipeline handles avatar audio input and synchronized audio/video output, giving you full control over the conversation logic. LemonSlice only focuses on delivering high-quality, real-time avatar video that is perfectly synchronized with your audio output.

The API creates a session that you connect to for bidirectional audio streaming and receiving synchronized avatar video.


## When to use the LemonSlice Self-Managed Pipeline

Use the Self-Managed Pipeline when you need complete control over your STT, LLM, and TTS stack. This option is ideal when you have specific requirements for your conversation logic, want to use particular AI models, or need to integrate with existing infrastructure.

The Self-Managed Pipeline currently works with [LiveKit](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/models/avatar/plugins/lemonslice/). A [Daily.co](Daily.co) integration is coming soon.

<Note>
The speed of your STT, LLM, and TTS processing directly affects the avatar's response time and interruption handling. Optimize these components for low latency to ensure natural, real-time conversations with timely interruption handling.
