## What is the LemonSlice Self-Managed Pipeline?

The Self-Managed Pipeline is standalone avatar model. Use it when you want full control over every component of your video agent pipeline.

Bring your own STT, LLM, and TTS. LemonSlice handles avatar generation only. You manage orchestration, infrastructure, and UI. Currently works with the LiveKit agents framework.

<Note>
The speed of your STT, LLM, and TTS processing directly affects the avatar's response time and interruption handling. Optimize these components for low latency to ensure natural, real-time conversations with timely interruption handling.
