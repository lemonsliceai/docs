## Getting Started

Follow these steps to create your first LemonSlice agent session and integrate it into your application.

### 1. Get your API key

Log into your LemonSlice dashboard and copy your **Server API Key**.\
All API requests must include this header:

```
X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

### 2. Create a room

Use the `POST /rooms` endpoint to create a Daily room pre-configured with a LemonSlice agent. The agent will automatically join the room once a client connects.

#### Example request

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.lemonslice.com/rooms \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "agent_id": "YOUR_AGENT_ID" }'
```

### 3. Join the room from your frontend

Use Daily’s JavaScript SDK to join the room using the URL + token returned from the API.

#### Example (JavaScript)

```javascript
import DailyIframe from "@daily-co/daily-js";

const callObject = DailyIframe.createCallObject();

await callObject.join({
  url: room_url,
  token: token
});
```

Once joined, the LemonSlice agent will connect and begin responding in the room.

### 4. Listen for LemonSlice events

LemonSlice uses Daily’s `app-message` channel to push events about the agent, image updates, and errors.

#### Example event handler

```javascript
useDailyEvent("app-message", (ev) => {
  if (ev?.data?.type === "bot_ready") {
    console.log("Agent is ready!");
  }
  if (ev?.data?.type === "daily_error") {
    console.log("An error occurred. ", ev?.data?.err_msg);
  }
});
```

### You're ready to build

With a room created, the agent connected, and event hooks wired up, you're ready to:

- Build interactive video AI apps
- Customize agent behavior
- Trigger image changes and respond to events

Explore the rest of the API docs for more capabilities.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using an **API key** sent in the `X-API-Key` header.

```bash
curl -X POST https://lemonslice.com/api/rooms \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "agent_id": "YOUR_AGENT_ID" }'
```

## LemonSlice Daily  Events

Hook into the Daily event handler to get LemonSlice specific events

### Event Types

| Event Type               | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| **bot_ready**            | Fired when the LemonSlice agent has successfully joined the Daily room and is ready to send/receive audio/video. |
| **image_created**        | A new agent look has been created for the agent—typically after an `/imagine` request has been made |
| **image_change_complete**| The agent's look has finished updating and the new look is now active. |
| **image_change_error**   | The agent failed to update its look. Includes an `err_msg` field with further details. |
| **daily_error**          | A Daily-related error occurred. Includes `err_msg`. |
| **video_generation_error** | A failure occurred while generating a video segment or rendering agent output. |

#### Full event handler:
```javscript
useDailyEvent(
  "app-message",
  useCallback((ev: DailyEventObjectAppMessage) => {
    if (ev?.data?.type === "bot_ready") {
      console.log("Agent has joined the room")
    }
    if (ev?.data?.type === "image_created") {
      console.log("New base image for Agent created")
    }
    if (ev?.data?.type === "image_change_complete") {
      console.log("Updated agent is ready")
    }
    if (ev?.data?.type === "image_change_error") {
      console.log("Failed to update agent", ev?.data?.err_msg)
    }
    if (ev?.data?.type === "daily_error") {
      console.log("An error occurred. ", ev?.data?.err_msg);
    }
    if (ev?.data?.type === "video_generation_error") {
      console.log("A video generation error occurred.");
    } 
  }, [])
);
```
