## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using an **API key** sent in the `X-API-Key` header.

```bash
curl -X POST https://lemonslice.com/api/rooms \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "agent_id": "YOUR_AGENT_ID" }'
```

### Event Types

| **`image_change_error`**     | The agent failed to update its look. Includes an `error` field with additional details. |
| **`daily_error`**            | A Daily-related error occurred. Includes `error` and `fatal` fields. |
