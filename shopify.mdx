Most of the files that Shopify uses to define themes are written in Liquid, Shopify's templating language. To embed a Lemon Slice agent into your Shopify site, you'll need to edit the Liquid file that defines that layout of your page.

### Prerequisites

1. A Lemon Slice Agent created on a paid plan
1. Some familiarity with Shopify's code editor

### Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get an embed code">
    Visit the Lemon Slice [agents platform](https://lemonslice.com/agents) to find your agent's embed widget. It should look something like this:

    ```javascript
    <lemon-slice-widget agent-id="AGENT_ID_HERE"></lemon-slice-widget>
    <script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@lemonsliceai/lemon-slice-widget"></script>
    ```

    Copy this embed code.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open your Shopify code editor">

    In your Shopify editor, click the three dots (<Icon icon="ellipsis" />) at the upper left corner. Then, click "Edit code" to open your Shopify code editor.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Place your embed code in your layout file">
    1. In the side menu, navigate to the `theme.liquid` file inside your `layout` folder.
    2. Inside the \<body\> tag, paste your embed code from step 1 before the first` <script>` tag. 
    3. Then, save your file with <Icon icon="command" /> + S on Mac, or Ctrl + S on Windows.
