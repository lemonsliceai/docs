## What is the LemonSlice Widget?

A fully-managed conversational AI service and UI component. Use it when you want the fastest path to adding an interactive avatar to your site.

Create a video agent in the LemonSlice web app. Customize the appearance, voice, personality, and knowledge base of your agent. Finally, copy the embed code and paste it on your site.


## Using the widget

Add the widget to any webpage with a single HTML tag in your header.

```html
<lemon-slice-widget agent-id="agent_id"></lemon-slice-widget>
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@lemonsliceai/lemon-slice-widget"></script>
```

## Interacting with the widget

We designed the LemonSlice agent widget to fluidly switch between being an unintrusive yet captivating state, an immersive calling experience, and a fully hidden state.

By default, users see the widget at the **minimized state**, with your welcome video playing on loop. If the user clicks to start a chat, they'll enter the **active state**, allowing them to chat with the agent. If the user hovers over the widget in the minimized state and clicks the minimize icon <Icon icon="arrow-down-left-and-arrow-up-right-to-center" />, this collapses the widget into the **hidden state**.

The widget is pinned to the corner of your website by default, to allow for a persistent experience across pages.
