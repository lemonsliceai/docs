## Installation

Add the widget to any webpage with a single HTML tag in your header.

```html
<lemon-slice-widget agent-id="agent_id"></lemon-slice-widget>
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@lemonsliceai/lemon-slice-widget"></script>
```

## Interacting with the widget

We designed the Lemon Slice agent widget to fluidly switch between being an unintrusive yet captivating state, an immersive calling experience,  and a fully hidden state.

By default, users see the widget at the **minimized state**, with your welcome video playing on loop. If the user clicks to start a chat, they'll enter the **active state**, allowing them to chat with the agent. If the user hovers over the widget in the minimized state and clicks the minimize icon <Icon icon="arrow-down-left-and-arrow-up-right-to-center" />, this collapses the widget into the \*\*hidden state. \*\*

The widget is pinned to the corner of your website by default, to allow for a persistent experience across pages.
