## Getting Started

Follow these steps to create your first Lemon Slice agent session and integrate it into your application.

### 1. Get your API key

Log into your Lemon Slice dashboard and copy your **Server API Key**.\
All API requests must include this header:

```
X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

### 2. Create a room

Use the `POST /rooms` endpoint to create a Daily room configured with a Lemon Slice agent. The agent will automatically join the room once it's startup is complete.

#### Example request

```bash
curl -X POST https://lemonslice.com/api/rooms \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "agent_id": "YOUR_AGENT_ID" }'
```

### 3. Join the room from your frontend

Use Daily’s JavaScript SDK to join the room using the URL + token returned from the API.

#### Example (JavaScript)

```javascript
import DailyIframe from "@daily-co/daily-js";

const callObject = DailyIframe.createCallObject();

await callObject.join({
  url: room_url,
  token: token
});
```

Once joined, the Lemon Slice agent will connect and begin responding in the room.

### 4. Listen for Lemon Slice events

Lemon Slice uses Daily’s `app-message` channel to push events about the agent, image updates, and errors.

#### Example event handler

```javascript
useDailyEvent("app-message", (ev) => {
  if (ev?.data?.type === "bot_ready") {
    console.log("Agent is ready!");
  }
  if (ev?.data?.type === "daily_error") {
    console.log("An error occurred. ", ev?.data?.err_msg);
  }
});
```

### You're ready to build

With a room created, the agent connected, and event hooks wired up, you're ready to:

- Build interactive video AI apps
- Customize agent behavior
- Trigger image changes and respond to events
