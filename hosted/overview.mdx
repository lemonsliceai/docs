## What is the LemonSlice API?

The LemonSlice API lets you programmatically spin up real-time experiences around a Lemon Slice agent—either by creating a ready-to-join Daily room, or by creating a low-level “session” for transport-based real-time A/V pipelines.

If you’re building an end-user video call experience, you’ll typically start with [Create room](https://lemonslice.com/docs/api-reference/create-room).  
If you’re building a deeper realtime integration (e.g., LiveKit Agents), you’ll typically start with [Create session](https://lemonslice.com/docs/api-reference/create-session).
