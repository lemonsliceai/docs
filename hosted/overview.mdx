## What is the LemonSlice Hosted Pipeline?

The Hosted Pipeline is a fully-managed conversational AI service. Use it when you want to control the frontend experience while letting LemonSlice handle everything else.

Create a video agent in the LemonSlice web app and get the agent ID. LemonSlice manages STT (transcription), LLM, TTS, and avatar generation. You handle the UI. Currently works with [Daily.co](Daily.co) rooms and UI components.
